I created cashier.c file and after saving it, I exited the editor. I used the command line \ngcc cashier.c -o cashier to compile the progra m, which created an executable file cashier. I checked the \nexecutable file by listing all the files in the directory using ls -l. I confirmed the program executed and \ngenerated the correct output by running the command ./cashier, entering sample inputs for  quantity and \npayments, and receiving the change and receipt in the output. All the steps were documented in a word \nfile, which was later converted to a PDF and submitted as part of the project.  \n \n",
